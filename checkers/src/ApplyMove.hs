    Apply move to the game state.

    For both colors,
    If the starting piece is a king, then update the coordinate.
    If the starting piece is a pawn but end up been a king, 
    then remove the pawn from pawn list and add it to king list.
    If the starting piece is a pawn and no change, then update the coordinate.
    Otherwise, this simple move is invalid.

    Apply a given jump move.

    Similar to make_simple_move. 
    Since a jump move envolves multiple steps, update game state after each step,
    and recursively invoke make_jump_move for following steps.
    For each step, if there are oponent's piece to be middle, 
    remove the piece as well.

    pc_start, pc_end:   P/K start and P/K end. PorK Coord type.
    start, end:         Coord start and Coord end. Coord type.
    jump:               The coordinate of middle piece, if there is any.
    gj:                 Recursively invoke make_jump_move for following steps.
    gh:                 Append current step to history stack recuesively.
                        This function is wrapping on the outside of gj, 
                        the base case of gj is appending the last step to the game history as a list,
                        every time recursived gj returns, gh appends the current step to the 
                        head of game history. This ends up with every step been appended to
                        the game history, inverted recursively.
    gb, gr:             Common game state change for removing middle oponent's piece.
