leaves Tip = 1
leaves(Node a t1 t2 ... tq) = leaves t1 + leaves t2 + ... + leaves tq

nodes Tip = 0
nodes(Node a t1 t2 ... tq) = 1 + nodes t1 + nodes t2 + ... + nodes tq

q Tip = 0
q(Node a t1 t2 ... tq) = q

Now can you prove that for a q-ary branching tree that the number of leaves is one more than (q-1) times the number of nodes?
Namely prove: leaves t = 1 + (q t - 1) * nodes t


Proof: By structural induction:

    leaves Tip                  = 1
                                = 1 + -1 * 0
                                = 1 + (q t - 1) * nodes Tip

    leaves(Node a t1 t2 ... tq) = leaves t1 + leaves t2 + ... + leaves tq
                                = 1 + (q t - 1) * nodes t1 + 1 + (q t - 1) * nodes t2 + ... + 1 + (q t - 1) * nodes tq
                                = 1 + (q t - 1) * (1 + nodes t1 + nodes t2 + ... + nodes tq)
                                = 1 + (q t - 1) * nodes(Node a t1 t2 ... tq)
