Prove by structural induction for a ternary branching tree that the number of leaves of a ternary branching tree is one more than double the number of nodes.
Namely prove: leaves t = 1 + 2 * nodes t


Proof: By structural induction:

    leaves Tip              = 1
                            = 1 + 2 * 0
                            = 1 + 2 * nodes Tip

    leaves(Node a t1 t2 t3) = leaves t1 + leaves t2 + leaves t3
                            = 1 + 2 * nodes t1 + 1 + 2 * nodes t2 + 1 + 2 * nodes t3
                            = 1 + 2 * (1 + nodes t1 + nodes t2 + nodes t3)
                            = 1 + 2 * nodes(Node a t1 t2 t3)
