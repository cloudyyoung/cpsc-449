mystery :: (Eq a) => [a] -> SF a
mystery xs = foldr (\x y -> if (fst x == snd x) then SS (fst x) else y) FF (myzip xs (mytail xs))

-- Base case: FF, no repeated character next to each other
-- Steps: if the current pair has two same values, then return SS with the first element of the pair
--        else, move on to next pair
